<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CAR-T Cellular Immunotherapy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Allogeneic</li><li>Autologous</li></ul></p>
<p><p>CAR-T cellular immunotherapy comprises two primary market types: autologous and allogeneic. Autologous CAR-T therapy utilizes a patient’s own T-cells, which are genetically modified to target cancer cells, providing a personalized treatment but with a longer preparation time. In contrast, allogeneic CAR-T therapy employs T-cells derived from healthy donors, allowing for a faster and scalable approach. While autologous therapies offer tailored solutions, allogeneic options present broader accessibility and the potential for off-the-shelf treatments in the market.</p></p>
